# Project: Members Only!

This is part of The Odin Projectâ€™s Ruby on Rails Curriculum. It's about building an exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.
